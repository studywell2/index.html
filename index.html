        Akingbehin Abideen aka studywell is a front-end web developer with a solid background in JavaScript frameworks
        like ReactJS and Vue.js and is also intimately familiar with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js)
        software stack.
        Timiace is the founder of Aceweb, a Drupal development company that specializes in the development of large
        technically complex B2B, B2C, and C2C projects.

        One challenginTo become a Web Developer, you should have an understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s
        also recommended to learn about CSS and CSS frameworks. Developing these fundamental web development skills will
        give you the foundation and logic for communicating with programming languages.

        g goal when creating web animations is striking a balance between eye-catching visuals and overly flashy noise.
        This agency site achieves that balance, sporting slick animations that appear only on the initial scroll,
        showing off the team's CSS capabilities.

        After the page sections have loaded, the site is largely static except for tasteful mouseover effects, giving
        the viewer time to process the information on the page.
        For those who have interest in becoming a web developer here is a guide.

    <p><b>How to become a developer in five steps:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn web development fundamentals</li>
        <li>choose a development specialization</li>
        <li>Learn key programming languages for web development</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Learn web development fundamentals</b></li>
        <p>The best first step to becoming a Web Developer is to start learning web development fundamentals, including
            an understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.

            Many aspiring Web Developers are now using coding bootcamps to fast-track the learning process. Coding
            bootcamps have thrived because they are short, immersive, and focused on outcomes and employment – their
            goal is to develop job-ready skills as efficiently as possible, making them an increasingly worthwhile
            investment for a would-be Web Developer. According to the job site Indeed, four out of five companies in the
            U.S. have hired a graduate from a coding bootcamp.

            In fact, the practical advantages of coding bootcamps are only getting clearer over time. For one thing, the
            field of web development naturally attracts people from all other fields, many of them making mid-career
            transitions – people for whom a clear and efficient path to skills expansion is a top priority. Further,
            employers increasingly value skills and experience over education, placing anyone who can prove their
            abilities on more equal footing with Developers holding a college degree.

            It’s important to note that Web Developers more than most other fields – must be committed to ongoing
            learning to stay on top of changes in web development and programming languages, tools, and trends. This
            makes mid-career retraining a must whether or not it’s the line of work you started out in.</p>
        <li><b>choose a web development specialization</b></li>
        <p>As you continue to grow your skills, you’ll need to choose an area of specialization. But what are the types
            of web development? All Web Developers are categorized into three main types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Front end developer:</b>A Front-End Developer works on the “client-side” of web development, meaning
                any portion of the site or app that users interact with. This can include a site’s layout, design, and
                the way users interact with it.</li>
            <li><b>Back end developer:</b>A Back-End Developer works on the “server-side” of web development. This is
                focused on the way a site functions and can include databases, servers, networks and hosting, and more.
            </li>
            <li><b>Fullstack Developer:</b>A Full-Stack Developer is familiar with both front-and back-end development
                and works with both sides of a website.
                3. Learn Key Programming Lang</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <li><b>Learn key programming languages for web development</b></li>
        </p>
        <p>Whatever your area of concentration, you’ll need to learn to code and know how to use a handful of different
            programming languages for web development and web design. So, what are the most common programming
            languages?

            Three families of programming languages form the basic tools involved in virtually all aspects of web
            development:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>HTML(hypertext markup language)</b></li>
            <li><b>CSS(cascading style sheet)</b></li>
            <li><b>JAVASCRIPT</b></li>
            <P>Of course, the list goes on – these are just the beginning. In fact, web development is such a diverse
                and varied field that the list of all the tasks it can include (and all the coding languages and markup
                languages you might use to accomplish them) is too long to fit in this space. Fortunately, as a
                specialist, you can find and concentrate on the ones that work best for you.</P>
